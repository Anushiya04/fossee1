# Interactive Python Code Generator for Arduino Control Using SvelteKit and Blockly

## Overview
This project is a web-based application that enables users to generate Python code for Arduino control using a visual programming interface powered by Blockly. The application simplifies the process of creating Arduino programs by allowing users to drag and drop custom blocks to control LEDs, implement delays, and handle button inputs.

## Features
- **Visual Programming:** Drag-and-drop interface using Blockly for creating Python code.
- **Custom Blocks:** Predefined blocks for LED control, delay, and button input.
- **Python Code Generation:** Generates Python code compatible with the pyFirmata library.
- **Download Functionality:** Users can download the generated code for direct use.
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Designed for users with minimal programming experience.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** SvelteKit
- **Visual Programming:** Blockly
- **Backend Integration:** pyFirmata (for Arduino control)
